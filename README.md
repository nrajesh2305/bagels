# How to Play:

I am thinking of a 3-digit number. 
Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:

When I say:        That means:
    Pico           One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
    Fermi          One digit is correct and in the right position.
    Bagels         No digit is correct.
    
You have 10 guesses to get it.
